After reviewing your statistical approaches in the Quarto document, I've identified several areas where the statistical methods could be improved for consistency and journal acceptance. Here's my comprehensive evaluation:

## Statistical Consistency Issues

### 1. **Multiple Comparison Corrections**
Your current approach is inconsistent across analyses. In Table 2, you're using unadjusted pairwise t-tests for each date, while in Table 3, you're correctly using Tukey adjustments via emmeans. For publication, you should standardize this approach.

**Recommendation**: Use Tukey HSD consistently for all post-hoc comparisons, or at minimum, apply Bonferroni corrections when making multiple t-tests within the same hypothesis.

### 2. **Mixed Model Considerations**
Your data has a hierarchical structure (repeated measures within plots across time) that isn't being fully accounted for. The simple ANOVA and t-tests treat observations as independent when they're not.

**Recommendation**: Consider using linear mixed-effects models (lme4 package) with plot as a random effect, especially for the flux and leaching data where you have multiple measurements per plot over time.

### 3. **Statistical Test Assumptions**
The code doesn't verify assumptions for parametric tests. Given that N₂O flux data is often right-skewed with many near-zero values, t-tests and ANOVA may not be appropriate.

**Recommendation**: Add diagnostic checks for normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and homoscedasticity (Levene's test), or consider non-parametric alternatives like Kruskal-Wallis tests.

## Specific Code Improvements

### For Table 2 (Soil Nitrogen):
Replace your current pairwise t-test function with a more robust approach:

```r
# Instead of unadjusted t-tests, use emmeans consistently
get_pairwise_contrasts <- function(data, variable, group_vars) {
  data %>%
    group_by(across(all_of(group_vars))) %>%
    group_modify(~ {
      if(n_distinct(.x$treatment) < 2) return(tibble(p_value = NA_real_))
      
      model <- lm(as.formula(paste(variable, "~ treatment")), data = .x)
      emm <- emmeans(model, ~ treatment)
      contrasts <- pairs(emm, adjust = "tukey")
      min_p <- min(summary(contrasts)$p.value)
      tibble(p_value = min_p)
    })
}
```

### For N₂O and Leaching Analyses:
Consider implementing a mixed model approach:

```r
# For cumulative annual data with plot-level replication
library(lmerTest)
n2o_model <- lmer(annual_cumulative_n2o ~ treatment * year + (1|plot), 
                  data = plot_cumulative_n2o)
n2o_emmeans <- emmeans(n2o_model, ~ treatment | year)
n2o_contrasts <- cld(n2o_emmeans, adjust = "tukey", Letters = letters)
```

### For Daily Flux Comparisons (Figure 1):
Your per-date t-tests in the soil moisture/temperature figure could lead to inflated Type I error. Consider:

```r
# Apply FDR correction for multiple date comparisons
pvals_adjusted <- pvals_moist %>%
  mutate(p_adj = p.adjust(p, method = "fdr")) %>%
  filter(p_adj < 0.05)
```

## Redundancy Removal

You have several redundant statistical calculations:
1. The helper function `get_pairwise_pvals()` is called multiple times with similar logic
2. Effect size calculations at the end aren't integrated into the main analysis
3. Multiple separate ANOVA calculations for the same table

**Streamlined approach**:
```r
# Single function for all statistical summaries
calculate_treatment_stats <- function(data, response_var, group_vars = c("year")) {
  data %>%
    group_by(across(all_of(group_vars))) %>%
    nest() %>%
    mutate(
      model = map(data, ~ lm(as.formula(paste(response_var, "~ treatment")), data = .x)),
      emmeans = map(model, ~ emmeans(.x, ~ treatment)),
      cld = map(emmeans, ~ cld(.x, adjust = "tukey", Letters = letters)),
      summary = map(cld, ~ as_tibble(.x))
    ) %>%
    unnest(summary) %>%
    select(-data, -model, -emmeans, -cld)
}
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Report confidence intervals** alongside p-values for effect sizes
2. **Include diagnostic plots** in supplementary materials (residual plots, Q-Q plots)
3. **State the statistical software versions** explicitly in methods
4. **Consider false discovery rate** (FDR) corrections for exploratory analyses
5. **Report exact p-values** (not just significance codes) in supplementary tables

These changes will strengthen the statistical rigor of your manuscript while maintaining clean, efficient code following tidyverse principles. The consistency in statistical approaches will make review smoother and increase acceptance likelihood.
