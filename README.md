# Impact of Cover Crops on Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Sorghum Systems

This repository contains data and analysis scripts for a study investigating the impact of cover crops on nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions in sorghum systems. The study compares N₂O fluxes from sorghum and sorghum intercropped with rye, as well as other treatments including corn and soy.
