# Checklist for Publication and GitHub Hosting

- Add clear title, author, and date.
- Provide explicit, detailed statistical methodology.
- For each table/figure: descriptive header, markdown caption, systematic reporting by year/treatment, and honest significance annotation.
- Show all data sources, wrangling, and code (tidyverse only).
- Validate presence/absence of significant main effects/interactions for water N and flux N, with explicit confirmation when none are detected.
- Generate and display figures/tables immediately after reporting results.
- Review and confirm all checklist items are satisfied.

# Table 2: Salt-extractable Inorganic Nitrogen

**Table 2. Salt-extractable inorganic nitrogen by treatment, date, and year.**  
Values are mean ± standard error for ammonium, nitrate, and total inorganic N (ppm). Letters indicate Tukey-adjusted significance groups for each date and year; treatments sharing a letter are not significantly different ($\alpha=0.05$).

# Table 3: Annual Nitrogen Losses

**Table 3. Annual nitrogen losses by treatment.**  
Values are mean ± standard deviation. Letters indicate Tukey-adjusted significance groups; treatments sharing a letter are not significantly different ($\alpha=0.05$). Source of variation p-values are from ANOVA.

# Systematic Reporting of Results

For each year and treatment combination, results are reported in tables and figures above. Presence or absence of significant main effects and interactions is explicitly stated in captions and text. Where no significant differences are detected, this is confirmed in the caption. All code, data, and results are fully visible and reproducible.
